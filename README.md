# Neural networks project notebook
This is the notebook file of my neural networks project. 
This should be run on the Kaggle environment. 
The Kaggle notebooks https://www.kaggle.com/qinhui1999/iwildcam-2020-efficientnetb7-tpu-starter-v1 and https://www.kaggle.com/krparekh24/iwild-2020-image-processing were used as a starting point for this notebook.

This is just the final version. Since I was working alone on the project I did not have the need to constantly commit my changes to a repository.
